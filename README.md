# MachineLearningRecepies
In this repo, I have added some recepies for performing classic ML algorithms from supervised learning to some more advanced algorithms.
The codes are written in Python (Jupyter notebook) and designed fro those who wants to start learning ML algorithms in more depth since I have been using just Numpy library and everything is implemented with that.
I think, for those who wants to have a kickstart, this code might be useful :)
