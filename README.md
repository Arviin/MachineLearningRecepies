# Machine Learning Recipes

This repository contains a collection of practical recipes for implementing classic machine learning algorithms — from foundational supervised learning models to more advanced techniques.

All code is written in **Python using Jupyter Notebooks**, and focuses on **pure NumPy implementations**. No external ML libraries are used.  
The goal is to provide an educational resource for learners who want to understand how machine learning works under the hood.

These notebooks are ideal for:
- Beginners who want to go beyond black-box libraries
- Students looking to deepen their intuition for ML algorithms
- Anyone curious about the step-by-step math and code behind common models

Feel free to explore, modify, and use! 🚀
