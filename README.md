# Machine Learning Recipes

This repository contains a collection of practical recipes for implementing classic machine learning algorithms — from foundational supervised learning models to more advanced techniques.

All code is written in **Python using Jupyter Notebooks**, and includes:

- 🔧 **Pure NumPy implementations** — to help you understand the core mechanics of each algorithm without relying on external ML libraries.
- ⚙️ **Scikit-learn implementations** — to demonstrate how the same models can be applied efficiently using industry-standard tools.


The goal is to provide an educational resource for learners who want to understand how machine learning works under the hood.

These notebooks are ideal for:
- Beginners who want to go beyond black-box libraries
- Students looking to deepen their intuition for ML algorithms
- Anyone curious about the step-by-step math and code behind common models

Feel free to explore, modify, and use! 🚀
